            Coming to life as a chunk of stone, Tiny's origins are a mystery
            on which he continually speculates. He is a Stone Giant now, but
            what did he used to be? A splinter broken from a Golem's heel? A
            shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop? A fragment of the
            Oracular Visage of Garthos? A deep curiosity drives him, and he
            travels the world tirelessly seeking his origins, his parentage,
            his people. As he roams, he gathers weight and size; the forces
            that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever
            grow.

        <h2>Spectre</h2>
        <p>
            Just as higher states of energy seek a lower level, the Spectre
            known as Mercurial is a being of intense and violent energy who
            finds herself irresistibly drawn to scenes of strife as they
            unfold in the physical world. While her normal spectral state
            transcends sensory limitations, each time she takes on a physical
            manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of self--though not of
            purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters and
            reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that
            she is Mercurial the Spectre--and that all of her Haunts are but
            shadows of the one true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for
            survival; her true mind reasserts itself; until in the final
            moments of victory or defeat, she transcends matter and is
            restored once more to her eternal form.

            和所有强大的能量都喜欢欺凌弱小一样，被称为墨丘利的幽鬼也是一个拥有着强横能量的存在，同样的，她对现实世界中的冲突和纷争无比着迷。然而她平时的幽鬼形态超越了常人的感知范围，因此每当她以实体形态出现时，她不得不损失一部分自我能量——尽管她也不愿意。在战斗中，她的自我意识逐渐散落并重新聚合，她也开始有了意识。她意识到了自己是幽鬼墨丘利——其他所有的鬼影都只是她自我的阴影。出于重新凝聚的打算，她开始专注，她的心智也在不断的成熟。只有等到她取得胜利或者彻底失败时，她那超物质的形态才会得以重聚。

        <h2>Ancient Apparition</h2>
        <p>
        Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside
        time. He springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the
        universe and awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall
        be...and what we perceive, powerful as it appears to us, is but the
        faintest faded echo of the true, eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as
        the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and
        power of Kaldr will also intensify--that the Ancient Apparition will
        grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws nigh. His grip of
        ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too
        terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!

        卡德尔，极寒幽魂，是时光之外的冰冷投影。他来自寒冷的无尽虚空，目睹宇宙诞生，见证宇宙终结。卡德尔是夕在，今在，永在的无上力量...我们的所有认知，所有自认为正确的强大的事物，在永恒的卡德尔看来，不过是最细微最无力的附和。有人相信，随着宇宙的老化并走向衰亡，卡德尔的力量和光芒也将变得更强——极寒幽魂将更加年轻，更加强大。他对冰霜的控制能够冻结一切事物，他的投影放出的光芒异常夺目。他将不再是幽魂，而是神!

        <h2>Weaver</h2>
        <p>
        The fabric of creation needs constant care, lest it grow tattered;
        for when it unravels, whole worlds come undone. It is the work of
        the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the
        mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay
        their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an
        entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr
        was a master Weaver, charged with keep one small patch of creation
        tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It
        nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past;
        the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create
        rather than merely maintain--to weave worlds of his own devising. He
        began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation
        proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the
        pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their
        scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic
        tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found
        himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been
        torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was
        free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials
        he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to
        do was tear apart this old world at the seams.

        创世之纱需要长期细心的照料，以防止其变得残破；因为一旦它散开了，整个世界就将毁于一旦。编织者的工作就是保持创世之纱的紧密，用现实之网修补它的破损。他们同样要防止那些在创世之纱的缺口上产卵或者侵蚀创世之纱的虫子，只要编织者稍微分心，这些家伙的幼虫就能吞噬掉整个宇宙。斯吉茨格尔是一名大师级的编织者，负责维护一块小补丁的紧密。然而这项任务并不能满足他，他经常唠叨过去那些原始的创造工作，对干完活就走人的世界纺织者也是颇有微词。他想创造，不想只是维护——他想按自己的设计编织出自己的世界。他开始在他负责的区域上做手脚，逐渐不能自拔，他的胆子也愈发的大，甚至私自改动了世界纺织者编织的图案。最后，守卫者来了，毁掉了编织者所作的一切，直接从创世之纱上去除了这一块，然后重新编织，却不让他参与其中。斯吉茨格尔现在孤身一人，被种群所弃，换做任何其他编织者，都会备受折磨。然而斯吉茨格尔却无比愉悦，因为他终于自由了，能够自由的创造，重头开始。他创造新世界所需的所有材料都触手可及。他只需要从缺口处将现在的世界撕裂。

        A towering being of unimaginable evil, Lucifer the Doom Bringer
        marches the farthest reaches of the world in search of new and
        exciting ways to satisfy his taste for unrest and greed. Once a
        feared leader in the army of the Purgers of the Realm, Doom left his
        position as a comrade of fellow demonic warriors as he simply could
        not bear the thought of sharing the glory of pillaging and feats of
        destruction with other lowly demons. Despite no longer leading an
        army, Doom is a fearful foe in combat, possessing mastery of hellish
        magic and physical attacks - eventually, the world will belong to
        Doom.

        <h2>Dragon Knight</h2>
        <p>
        After years on the trail of a legendary Eldwurm, the Knight Davion
        found himself facing a disappointing foe: the dreaded Slyrak had
        grown ancient and frail, its wings tattered, its few remaining
        scales stricken with scale-rot, its fangs ground to nubs, and its
        fire-gouts no more threatening than a pack of wet matchsticks.
        Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, Knight Davion
        prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a
        voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that
        Davion might honor him with death in combat. Davion agreed, and
        found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As
        he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon pierced Davion's
        throat with a talon. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power
        out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of
        wisdom to the knight. The dragon's death sealed their bond and
        Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the Dragon
        Knight Davion, waking when he calls it. Or perhaps it is the Dragon
        that calls the Knight...

        <h2>Venomancer</h2>
        <p>
        In the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle, poison runs in the veins and
        bubbles in the guts of every creature that scuttles, climbs or
        swoops between fluorescent vines dripping with caustic sap. Yet even
        in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most
        venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of
        Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be
        extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare
        transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a
        reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly
        plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the
        jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled)
        reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an
        antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him
        completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell
        into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot
        where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus:
        Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer--but Lesale the
        Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been
        consumed and replaced by a new type of matter--one fusing the venom
        of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's
        Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most
        vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The
        lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the
        heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new
        poisons--and new deaths to bring.

        <h2>Dark Seer</h2>
        <p>
        Fast when he needs to be, and a cunning strategist, Ish'Kafel the
        Dark Seer requires no edged weapons to vanquish his enemies, relying
        instead on the strength of his powerful mind. His talent lies in his
        ability to maneuver the fight to his advantage. Hailing from a place
        he calls 'The Land behind the wall,' Dark Seer remains an outsider
        here—a warrior from a realm beyond the veil of this reality. Once a
        great general among his people, and a valiant defender of the
        god-king Damathryx, Dark Seer’s army was wiped out by a much larger
        force in the final days of the Great Boundaries War. Facing certain
        defeat, he made one last desperate act: he led the enemy forces into
        the maze between the walls. At the last moment, just before capture,
        he crossed over—then sealed the walls forever in an explosive
        release of dark energy. When the dust settled, he saw that he had
        saved his people but found himself blinking at the sun of a
        different world, with no way to return. Now he is committed to
        proving his worth as a military strategist, and vows to show that
        he’s the greatest tactician this strange new world has ever seen.
